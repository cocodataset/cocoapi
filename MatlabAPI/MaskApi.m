classdef MaskApi
  % Interface for manipulating masks stored in RLE format.
  %
  % RLE is a simple yet efficient format for storing binary masks. RLE
  % first divides a vector (or vectorized image) into a series of piecewise
  % constant regions and then for each piece simply stores the length of
  % that piece. For example, given M=[0 0 1 1 1 0 1] the RLE counts would
  % be [2 3 1 1], or for M=[1 1 1 1 1 1 0] the counts would be [0 6 1]
  % (note that the odd counts are always the numbers of zeros). Instead of
  % storing the counts directly, additional compression is achieved with a
  % variable bitrate representation based on a common scheme called LEB128.
  %
  % Compression is greatest given large piecewise constant regions.
  % Specifically, the size of the RLE is proportional to the number of
  % *boundaries* in M (or for an image the number of boundaries in the y
  % direction). Assuming fairly simple shapes, the RLE representation is
  % O(sqrt(n)) where n is number of pixels in the object. Hence space usage
  % is substantially lower, especially for large simple objects (large n).
  %
  % Many common operations on masks can be computed directly using the RLE
  % (without need for decoding). This includes computations such as area,
  % union, intersection, inverse etc. All of these operations are linear in
  % the size of the RLE, in other words they are O(sqrt(n)) where n is the
  % area of the object. Computing these operations on the original mask is
  % O(n). Thus, using the RLE can result in substantial computational savings.
  %
  % The following API functions are defined:
  %  encode - Encode binary masks using RLE.
  %  decode - Decode binary masks encoded via RLE.
  %  merge  - Compute union or intersection of encoded masks.
  %  iou    - Compute intersection over union between masks.
  %  nms    - Compute non-maximum suppression between ordered masks.
  %  area   - Compute area of encoded masks.
  %  invert - Compute inverse of encoded masks.
  %  crop   - Crop encoded masks to given bounding boxes.
  %  toBbox - Get bounding boxes surrounding encoded masks.
  %  frBbox - Convert bounding boxes to encoded masks.
  %  frPoly - Convert polygon to encoded mask.
  %
  % Usage:
  %  Rs     = MaskApi.encode( masks )
  %  masks  = MaskApi.decode( Rs )
  %  R      = MaskApi.merge( Rs, [intersect=false] )
  %  o      = MaskApi.iou( dt, gt, [iscrowd=false] )
  %  keep   = MaskApi.nms( dt, thr )
  %  a      = MaskApi.area( Rs )
  %  Rs     = MaskApi.invert( Rs )
  %  Rs     = MaskApi.crop( Rs, bbox )
  %  bbs    = MaskApi.toBbox( Rs )
  %  Rs     = MaskApi.frBbox( bbs, h, w )
  %  R      = MaskApi.frPoly( poly, h, w )
  %
  % In the API the following formats are used:
  %  R,Rs   - [struct] Run-length encoding of binary mask(s)
  %  masks  - [hxwxn] Binary mask(s) (must have type uint8)
  %  bbs    - [nx4] Bounding box(es) stored as [x y w h]
  %  poly   - Polygon stored as {[x1 y1 x2 y2...],[x1 y1 ...],...}
  %  dt,gt  - May be either bounding boxes or encoded masks
  % Both poly and bbs are 0-indexed (bbox=[0 0 1 1] encloses first pixel).
  %
  % Finally, a note about the intersection over union (iou) computation.
  % The standard iou of a ground truth (gt) and detected (dt) object is
  %  iou(gt,dt) = area(intersect(gt,dt)) / area(union(gt,dt))
  % For "crowd" regions, we use a modified criteria. If a gt object is
  % marked as "iscrowd", we allow a dt to match any subregion of the gt.
  % Choosing gt' in the crowd gt that best matches the dt can be done using
  % gt'=intersect(dt,gt). Since by definition union(gt',dt)=dt, computing
  %  iou(gt,dt,iscrowd) = iou(gt',dt) = area(intersect(gt,dt)) / area(dt)
  % For crowd gt regions we use this modified criteria above for the iou.
